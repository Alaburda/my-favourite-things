## Tomato Sauce


Tomato Sauce III

2 lbs plum tomatoes (sweeter than regular)

1/4 lb butter

1 medium yellow onion, peeled and halved. (These are also sweeter and more mellow than white onions.)

1/4 teaspoon granulated sugar

Step 1: Half the tomatoes and simmer in a covered pot for ten minutes. Puree in a blender or with a hand blender.

Step 2: Add the rest of the ingredients to the pot with the tomatoes and cook on a slow simmer, uncovered, for 45 minutes.

Just toss the tomatoes, butter, a halved onion, and salt into a saucepan, bring to a simmer, and let it cook slowly and steadily for about 45 minutes
